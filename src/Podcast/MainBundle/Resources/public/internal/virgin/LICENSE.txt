Virgin is my original work.
This theme is multi useful theme.
Can be used as an admin theme, a portfolio theme, a buisness template, or well.. just a theme.
Documentation takes care that this theme us easily understandable
Charts are rendered using google charts... so again.. you just have to supply data... nothing more required

The main features of this theme is not the amount of goodies that come with it.
The main feature is that ... this theme has predefined functions for almost everything that this theme requires.... hence no coding required from your side.

Even Markdown is supported.

Oh yeah... and a commandline is also included for programming geeks.


So forget coding stuff.
and Start using Virgin.

Virgin symbolizes genesis of new era.
with clean themes and great UI.
This theme can adapt to almost every device. 
The Extra responsiveness takes care of that.

If You like my work... please donate some help to keep me supporting myself through college and bring awesome apps to public. :)


P.S. I don't think i made a theme... this is an app i suppose.
